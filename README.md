//Blue Rain 



//What is your selected coding challenge?

I have chosen #4 Purple Rain from the Coding Challenge. 



//What function/syntax have you added?

I have changed the size of the canvas so it looks like it rains all over your screen. 
I have also changed the colors of the background and the rain drops so create another coding experience. 
Therefore I changed the name of the coding challenge to "Blue Rain" instead.



//What is the difficulty of this week mini exercise?

I think it is to create a flowchart that is suitable for the program and using the right boxes to show the process, decision and so on. 



//How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow chart?

It is a good way to show a solution to a hole problem even when there are can be complex. 
It is a useful tool to visually make structure and organize the ideas. Once a flowchart is drawn, it becomes comparatively easy to write the program in any high level language. In other words, flowcharts are mandatory for good documentation of a complex program.
